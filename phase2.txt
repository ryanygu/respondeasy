Features:
There is one type of user. Every user can be a normal user or an admin of their own events. 
When you login, you will be presented to the dashboard page with a list of upcoming events and my events.

As a user of this application, you will be able to edit your profile when you click the icon on the top right.

Bug: There is a small bug with updating contents in the dashboard. 
     After a user created an event or joins an event or edits profile, they need to refresh the browser and re-login to see their changes.

Use case (host):
The host of the event want to use our app because it is an easy way to manage their event.
This user can create an event by:
- Creating their own account.
- Click 'CREATE' on the header.
- Fill out the form, which asks for the lucky couple, the time and date, and food options.
- They will then be redirected to their event dashboard, as a host.
    - In the 'Overview' page, as the host of this event, you will be displayed of the Event Code. This code will be used for other users to join this event. 
        You can also edit the event information in this Overview page.

Use case (guest):

A guest of a wedding would receive an email invite with an invite code. 
They will use this code to inform the host whether or not they are coming. 
This user can get there by:
- Creating their own account. 
- Click 'JOIN' on the header.
- Enter the code given in the email invite, and accept or decline your invitation.
- Once a user joins an event as a guest (or declines the invitation), they will be redirected back to the dashboard.
- Here, a user can see all of their upcoming events.
- Clicking one of them allows you to see the event details.
