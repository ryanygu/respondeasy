# RespondEZ

RespondEZ is a platform that streamlines the process of wedding invitations. Our platform handles the communication between event host and attendee to ensure a stress-free experience from both parties.

Front end done in React.js. Routing handled with Express.js. Back end done with Node.js, MongoDB (mLab), and Mongoose.

### Usage

Install the dependencies and run the client and server using concurrently.

Note: the server runs on ```http://localhost:5000``` and client runs on ```http://localhost:3000```.

```
git clone
cd team33
npm install
npm run client-install
npm run dev 
```
Then navigate to `localhost:3000` in the browser of your choice.
Note: only tested on Google Chrome.
